An incredible Pet Project to help users shorten their links. To make the resource look less sparse, a versatile, bright and memorable design was created and developed. The site can be accessed via a link: https://shine-shortly.netlify.app/

While working on the project, React, Figma (design development), API used. The idea of the pet project was taken from a third-party resource.
